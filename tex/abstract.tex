Iris images quality in iris recognition systems are strongly related to the segmentation step success, as the segmentation quality in the iris feature extraction step that identifies uniquely a person. This project consists of a study on the application of two quality metrics, one for measuring the quality of iris images in the visible light wavelength and the other for measuring the iris segmentation step quality in iris recognition systems. An iris recognition framework is proposed with the quality metrics Differential Sign-Magnitude Statistics Index (DSMI) and Feature Correlation Evaluation (FCE). The experiments were performed using an open source iris recognition system and four visible light wavelength iris image datasets. The proposed framework improved considerably the performance of iris recognition systems in two of the datasets with images captured in a more controlled environment and improved a little or got worse the performance in the other two datasets. However, the two unfavorable results are more related to the datasets than the proposed framework, so it can be affirmed that the framework has the potential for being applied in iris recognition systems.
