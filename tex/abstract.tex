Iris images quality in iris recognition systems are strongly related on the segmentation step success, as the segmentation quality in the iris feature extraction step that identifies uniquely a person. This project consists of a study on the application of two quality metrics, one for measuring the quality of iris images in the visible light wavelength and the other for measuring the iris segmentation step quality in iris recognition systems. An iris recognition framework is proposed with the quality metrics Differential Sign-Magnitude Statistics Index (DSMI) and Feature Correlation Evaluation (FCE). The experiments were performed using an open source iris recognition system and four visible light wavelength iris image datasets. The two quality metrics for filtering poor quality images and segmentations presented good and bad results, depending on the dataset that were applied, but have shown potential for their applcation in iris recognition systems.
